        "abstract": "The rich multimedia-enhanced language content offered by modern commercial off-the-shelf games and students\u2019 interest in playing such games has motivated efforts for seeking effective means to integrate them into the curriculum to enrich and enhance foreign language learning. Despite the general interest and appeal of game-enhanced learning in foreign language learning, there is a need for strategies for effective curriculum integration and empirical studies to test the effects of such interventions systematically. This study aims to contribute to this need by investigating the effectiveness of a ten-week-long game-enhanced language learning intervention on English foreign language learning. The study employed an embedded mixed methods design, including a controlled experiment and semi-structured interviews. The experiment group (n\u2009",

        "abstract": "This paper presents our recent experiences with the design of game-like applications in 3-D virtual environments as well as its impact on student motivation and learning. Therefore our paper starts with a brief analysis of the motivational aspects of videogames and virtual worlds (VWs). We then go on to explore the possible benefits of both in the area of foreign language learning. For our research study we have designed a VW-platform, called VirtUAM. This permits us to store and record data related to users' behaviour within the VW. Furthermore the platform has been employed to build several islands (virtual spaces), which implement different game levels. The virtual spaces themselves are used to give students a basic training in different language skills related to the German language. In order to obtain data regarding the game's impact on student learning and motivation, we designed several tests, which were completed both before and after the student participants played the game. Additionally we gave them a general questionnaire, which was only filled out after the game and which aimed at getting personal feedback from the learners. Quantitative and qualitative results shown in this work are part of a larger project which intends to study the impact of game-like applications within virtual environments and with regard to teaching and learning processes in general.",

        "abstract": "In the context of European Higher Education students face an increasing focus on independent, individual learning\u2014at the expense of face-to-face interaction. Hence learners are, all too often, not provided with enough opportunities to negotiate in the target language. The current case study aims to address this reality by going beyond conventional approaches to provide students with a hybrid game-based app, combining individual and collaborative learning opportunities. The 4-week study was carried out with 104 German language students (A1.2 CEFR) who had previously been enrolled in a first-semester A1.1 level course at a Spanish university. The VocabTrainerA1 app\u2014designed specifically for this study\u2014harnesses the synergy of combining individual learning tasks and a collaborative murder mystery game in a hybrid level-based architecture. By doing so, the app provides learners with opportunities to apply their language skills to real-life-like communication. The purpose of the study was twofold: on one hand we aimed to measure learner motivation, perceived usefulness and added value of hybrid game-based apps; on the other, we sought to determine their impact on language learning. To this end, we conducted focus group interviews and an anonymous Technology Acceptance Model survey (TAM). In addition, students took a pre-test and a post-test. Scores from both tests were compared with the results obtained in first-semester conventional writing tasks, with a view to measure learning outcomes. The study provides qualitative and quantitative data supporting our initial hypotheses. Our findings suggest that hybrid game-based apps like VocabTrainerA1\u2014which seamlessly combine individual and collaborative learning tasks\u2014motivate learners, stimulate perceived usefulness and added value, and better meet the language learning needs of today\u2019s digital natives. In terms of acceptance, outcomes and sustainability, the data indicate that hybrid game-based apps significantly improve proficiency, hence are indeed, effective tools for enhanced language learning.",

        "abstract": "Apart from being used as a means of entertainment, computer games have been adopted for a long time as a valuable tool for learning. Computer games can offer many learning benefits to students since they can consume their attention and increase their motivation and engagement which can then lead to stimulate learning. However, most of the research to date on educational computer games, in particular learning versions of existing computer games, focused only on learner with typical development. Rather less is known about designing educational games for learners with special needs. The current research presents the results of a pilot study. The principal aim of this pilot study is to examine the interest of learners with hearing impairments in using an educational game for learning the sign language notation system SignWriting. The results found indicated that, overall, the application is useful, enjoyable and easy to use: the game can stimulate the students\u2019 interest in learning such notations",

Our study examines the effectiveness of game-based learning in planning education. Specifically, we explore the impact of gamification on planning students\u2019 perception of learning, engagement and teamwork. Two lectures in an undergraduate planning course were delivered using two different methods of teaching (one traditional lecture-style, one game-based). Feedback was gathered through an online questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. Results show that students favored and were more engaged in the game-based lecture. Finally, we contend that gamification is particularly well suited for planning education.",

        "abstract": "Former literature reviews or research syntheses on digital game-based learning have provided important results, but little is known about the use of digital games in specific learning domains, with language education being one fertile area for additional research. While the use of digital games for educational purposes varies in different contexts, understanding the emerging trends of how digital games are currently implemented in language learning can inform both language educators and researchers of game use for learning, and thus help to improve their professional practices. Accordingly, the current review aims to identify emerging trends of digital game-based language learning (DGBLL) articles published during years 2010 to 2014. Major findings of this review indicate that: 1) Only 4% of the articles are identified as related to DGBLL within the reviewed corpus, 2) most DGBLL researchers employed mixed methods, 3) higher education learners were the most frequently examined group of participants in DGBLL studies, 4) English was the target language studied by the majority of DGBLL researchers, and 5) Off-the-shelf digital games, particularly the type of Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPG), are the most commonly implemented games in the DGBLL literature. This review provides a panoramic overview of the trends in DGBLL research and draws attention to areas where there are prominent gaps within the literature.",

        "abstract": "Although educational games have become quite popular in recent research, only a limited number of studies have focused on the effectiveness of these games. While numerous claims have been made about the effectiveness of games, the studies that examine educational effectiveness often contain flaws resulting in unclear conclusions. One possible solution for these shortcomings is to focus on separate game elements rather than on games as a whole. A second solution is to take into account students\u2019 perceptions of instruction as they are likely to affect students\u2019 interpretations and learning outcomes. This study investigated whether the addition of the gaming element \u2018competition\u2019 to a computer-based language learning environment is related to students\u2019 motivation, perceptions and learning outcomes. Additionally, this study probed into the effect of instruction, i.e., the instruction of a gaming or learning environment, on students\u2019 perceptions of the environment, their motivation and learning outcomes. 83 students participated in this study, all working in a game-based learning environment for learning business English conversation skills. The results demonstrate that competition is not significantly related to students\u2019 learning gains and only partly related to students\u2019 motivation. Moreover, the majority of students perceived the environment as a learning environment, even when they were instructed to be playing in a gaming environment. To conclude this paper, the practical and theoretical implications for the fields of instructional design and educational games research are discussed.",

This scoping review investigates the current practices of digital game-based language learning to support English language learning, in terms of participants\u2019 characteristics, methodological features, gaming characteristics, and an association between game availability and gaming characteristics. Our results indicate: (1) vocabulary is the most dominant practiced language skills; (2) methods employed were primarily quantitative with researcher-designed tests; (3) commercial games contain the most elements of a good game; (4) use of good gaming elements is inconsistent among digital games. We provide strategies for educational researchers to improve their rigor in research, along with explicit criteria that digital game designers can apply toward language-learning game development. As educational technology continues to transform language learning, we emphasize the need for continued research and development that investigates how gaming elements in mobile learning environments may improve language-learning outcomes",
